# Specification Quality Checklist: WSD Generator and Cross-Format Validator

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/spec-kitty.clarify` or `/spec-kitty.plan`.
- Three key scope decisions were captured in the Clarifications section: default arrow styles (ALPS deferred), full cross-format validator with graceful skip, and runtime serving out of scope.
- The spec references "shared AST" from a forthcoming separate spec; this is documented as an assumption, not a NEEDS CLARIFICATION, since the user confirmed this direction.
