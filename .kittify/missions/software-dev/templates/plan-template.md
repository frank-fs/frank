# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/kitty-specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/spec-kitty.plan` command. See `src/specify_cli/missions/software-dev/command-templates/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

The planner will not begin until all planning questions have been answered—capture those answers in this document before progressing to later phases.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.

  If multiple developers/agents will work on this feature, add a "Parallel Work
  Organization" section below showing the dependency graph and agent assignments.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

### Source Code (repository root)
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real
directories captured above]

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Parallel Work Analysis

*Include this section if multiple developers/agents will implement this feature*

### Dependency Graph

```
[Identify what must be built sequentially vs what can be done in parallel]
Example:
Foundation (Day 1) → Wave 1 (Days 2-3, parallel) → Wave 2 (Days 4-5, parallel) → Integration (Day 6)
```

### Work Distribution

- **Sequential work**: [What must be done first before parallel work can begin]
- **Parallel streams**: [Independent work that can be done simultaneously]
- **Agent assignments**: [Who owns which files/modules to avoid conflicts]

### Coordination Points

- **Sync schedule**: [When parallel workers merge their changes]
- **Integration tests**: [How to verify parallel work integrates correctly]
