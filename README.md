[F#](https://fsharp.org/) [computation expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/computation-expressions), or builders, for configuring the [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostBuilder`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.hosting.iwebhostbuilder?view=aspnetcore-2.0) and defining routes for HTTP resources using [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-2.1).

This project was inspired by @filipw's [Building Microservices with ASP.NET Core (without MVC)](https://www.strathweb.com/2017/01/building-microservices-with-asp-net-core-without-mvc/).
