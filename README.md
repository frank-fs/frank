# Frank

Frank is resource-oriented wrapper library for working with the [Web API](http://wcf.codeplex.com/) and is developed in [F#](http://fsharp.net/).

## Goals

1. Provide a simple, to-the-metal framework for quickly building HTTP applications and services without a lot of hassle. In this case, "to-the-metal" means utilizing the new [HTTP stack coming in .NET 4.5](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh193585.aspx) and available now in the [`HttpClient`](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/HttpClient) library available with [Web API](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/WebApi.All).
2. Focus on composition over everything else. Based in F#, composition comes fairly naturally.
3. Run on a number of server platforms. Frank currently uses the [Web API](http://wcf.codeplex.com/) platform to allow it to run either atop [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) or self-hosted using the `HttpServiceHost`. Other hosting options will be made available soon.

## Usage

### Define an Application

One may define a web application interface using a large variety of signatures.
Indeed, if you search the web, you're likely to find a large number of approaches.
When starting with Frank, I wanted to try to find a way to define an HTTP application
using pure functions and function composition. The closest I found was the following:

    type HttpApplication = HttpRequestMessage -> Async<HttpResponseMessage>
    
    let orElse left right = fun request -> Option.orElse (left request) (right request)
    let inline (<|>) left right = orElse left right

The last of these was a means for merging multiple applications together into a single
application. This allowed for a nice symmetry and elegance in that everything you composed
would always have the same signature. Additional functions would allow you to map
applications to specific methods or uri patterns.

A "Hello, world!" application using these signatures would look like the following:

    let helloWorld request =
      async.Return <| HttpResponseMessage.ReplyTo(request, "Hello, world!")

A simple echo handler that returns the same input as it received might look like the following:

    let echo (request: HttpRequestMessage) =
      async.Return <| HttpResponseMessage.ReplyTo(request, request.Content, ``Content-Type`` "text/plain")

### Define an HTTP Resource

Alas, this approach works only so well. HTTP is a rich communication specification.
The simplicity and elegance of a purely functional approach quickly loses the ability
to communicate back options to the client. For instance, given the above, how do you
return a meaningful `405 Method Not Allowed` response? The HTTP specification requires
that you list the allowed methods, but if you merge all the logic for selecting an
application into the functions, there is no easy way to recall all the allowed methods,
short of trying them all. You could require that the developer add the list of used
methods, but that, too, misses the point that the application should be collecting this
and helping the developer by taking care of all of the nuts and bolts items.

The next approach I tried involved using a tuple of a list of allowed HTTP methods and
the application handler, which used the merged function approach described above for
actually executing the application. However, once again, there are limitations. This
structure accurately represents a resource, but it does not allow for multiple resources
to coexist side-by-side. Another tuple of uri pattern matching expressions could wrap
a list of these method * handler tuples, but at this point I realized I would be better
served by using real types and added an `HttpResource` type to ease the type burden.

HTTP resources expose an resource handler function at a given uri.
In the common MVC-style frameworks, this would roughly correspond
to a `Controller`. Resources should represent a single entity type,
and it is important to note that a `Foo` is not the same entity
type as a `Foo list`, which is where the typical MVC approach goes wrong. 

    type HttpResource =
      { Uri: string
        Methods: string list
        Handler: HttpRequestMessage -> Async<HttpResponseMessage> option }
      with
      member x.Invoke(request) =
        match x.Handler request with
        | Some(h) -> h
        | _ -> ``405 Method Not Allowed`` x.Methods request

The ``405 Method Not Allowed`` function allows a resource to correctly respond to messages.
Therefore, we extend the `HttpResource` with an `Invoke` method.
Also note that the methods will always be looked up using the latest set. This could
probably be memoized so as to save a bit of time, but it allows us to ensure that all
available methods are reported.

### Compose Applications and Resources into Applications

A compositional approach to type mapping and handler design.
Here, the actual function shows clearly that we are really using
the `id` function to return the very same result.

      let echo2Transform = id

The `echo2ReadRequest` maps the incoming request to a value that can be used
within the actual computation, or `echo2Transform` in this example.

      let echo2ReadRequest (request: HttpRequestMessage) =
          async { return! request.Content.AsyncReadAsString() }

The `echo2Respond` maps the outgoing message body to an HTTP response.

      let echo2Respond request body =
        async {
            return HttpResponseMessage.ReplyTo(request, body, ``Content-Type`` "text/plain") }

This `echo2` is the same in principle as `echo` above, except that the
logic for the message transform deals only with the concrete types
about which it cares and isn't bothered by the transformations.

      let echo2 request =
        async {
          let! content = echo2ReadRequest request
          let body = echo2Transform content
          return echo2Respond request body }

Create a `HttpResource` instance at the root of the site that responds to `POST`.

      let resource = route "/" <| post echo2

Other combinators are available to handle other scenarios, such as:

1. Content Negotiation
2. Building Responses
3. Combining applications into resources
4. Combining resources into applications

Check the samples for more examples of these combinators.

### Define a Middleware

Middlewares follow a Russian-doll model for wrapping resource handlers with additional functionality. Frank middlewares take an `HttpApplication` and return an `HttpApplication`.
The `Frank.Middleware` module defines several, simple middlewares, such as the `log` middleware that intercepts logs incoming requests and the time taken to respond:

    let log app = fun (request : HttpRequestMessage) ->
      async {
        let sw = System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew()
        let! response = app request
        printfn "Received a %A request from %A. Responded in %i ms."
                request.Method.Method request.RequestUri.PathAndQuery                                  sw.ElapsedMilliseconds
        sw.Reset()
        return response }

The most likely place to insert middlewares is the outer edge of your application. However, since middlewares are themselves just `HttpApplication`s, you can compose them into a Frank application at any level. Want to support logging only on one troublesome resource? No problem. Expose the resource as an application, wrap it in the log middleware, and insert it into the larger application as you did before.

## Hosting

The current hosting options depend entirely upon the options available from the
[Web API](http://wcf.codeplex.com/) library. In any case, you'll need a 
`WebApiConfiguration` instance created from each application you want to host.
The `WebApi.configure` function creates a `DelegatingHandler` that will intercept
all incoming traffic and route it to our resources.

    let config = WebApi.configure app

### Self-hosting

Create a self-hosted service host using an `WebApi.FrankApi`, as the service
won't actually do anything. The `WebApi.FrankApi` is simply a stub for the
`HttpServiceHost` to satisfy its requirements.

    let baseUri = "http://localhost:1000/"
    let host = new HttpServiceHost(typeof<WebApi.FrankApi>, config, [| baseUri |])
    host.Open()

    printfn "Host open.  Hit enter to exit..."
    printfn "Use a web browser and go to %A or do it right and get fiddler!" baseUri
    System.Console.Read() |> ignore

    host.Close()

### ASP.NET / IIS

[Web API](http://wcf.codeplex.com/) provides a `ServiceRoute` subclass of `RouteHandler`
with which to mount Web API applications. We can use this to mount Frank applications, as well.

    RouteTable.Routes.Add(new ServiceRoute("", new HttpServiceHostFactory(Configuration = config), typeof<WebApi.FrankApi>))

You may also use the extension to the `System.Web.RouteTable.Routes` to mount your Frank application:

    RouteTable.Routes.MapServiceRoute<WebApi.FrankApi>("", config)

or if you have a number of routes to set:

    RouteTable.Routes.SetDefaultHttpConfiguration(config)
    RouteTable.Routes.MapServiceRoute<WebApi.FrankApi>("")
